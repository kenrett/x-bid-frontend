## Accessibility (A11y) conventions

This project aims for predictable, screen-reader-friendly forms across auth, account, and checkout flows.

### Forms

- Every input must have a visible `<label>` with matching `htmlFor`/`id` (tests should use `getByLabelText`).
- Inline field errors:
  - Render in a stable element with `role="alert"` and a deterministic `id`.
  - Set `aria-invalid="true"` on the invalid input.
  - Point `aria-describedby` at the error element `id`.
- After submit:
  - Focus the first invalid field (by `aria-invalid="true"`).
  - If there are no field errors, focus the general error alert (make it focusable with `tabIndex={-1}`).
- Loading:
  - Disable submit buttons while requests are in-flight.
  - Set `aria-busy` on the `<form>` (or section) while submitting.

### Error screens

- Error-only views should render a focusable `role="alert"` container and move focus to it on mount.
